# Statement of Objectives
## 1.0 Background and Purpose
The GSA Center for Charge Card Management (hereinafter “CCCM”) administers the GSA SmartPay Program, which is the world’s largest government charge card and commercial payment solutions program. Providing services to nearly 600 federal government agencies, organizations, and Native American tribal governments, GSA SmartPay payment solutions enable authorized government employees to make purchases to support agency and organization missions.

### 1.1 Purpose
This program has interfaced and provided support to [users](https://github.com/GSA/smartpay-website/wiki/GSA-SmartPay%C2%AE-%7C-User-Types) through: (1) GSA SmartPay main website, and (2) GSA SmartPay training website.

#### 1.1.1 Current state
(1) The GSA SmartPay main website is available at [https://smartpay.gsa.gov](https://smartpay.gsa.gov/) and is:
- Built on a Drupal version 9 with PHP programming.
- Hosted on Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 servers.

The website received more than 1.8 million visitors (mobile & web) in FY22. Based on current content and development in progress, the Government anticipates that traffic will be driven by state sales tax content and visits to the Section 889 Representations tool.

Section 889 of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act prohibits purchases from certain banned telecommunication and video surveillance equipment in an effort to protect national security. The [Section 889 Representations tool](https://889.smartpay.gsa.gov/#/) searches for company 889 status with Unique Entity Identifier (UEI), company name, or Commercial and Government Entity code (CAGE) number via the SAM.gov Entity Management application programming interface (API). The current 889 Representation tool is:
- Built on GSA’s instance of Google Cloud Platform.
- Developed with Python (back-end) and Vue.js (front-end). 

(2) The GSA SmartPay training website, which is available at [https://training.smartpay.gsa.gov](https://training.smartpay.gsa.gov/), provides mandatory training to card/account holders, approving officials (AOs), and agency/organization program coordinators (A/OPCs), as required by law and policy. This offering is optional for agencies to use (some prefer to host their own content in their learning management systems. The current GSA SmartPay training website:
- Is built on a Drupal version 9 with PHP programming.
- Is hosted on Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 8 servers.
- Uses a MariaDB database.
- Has five (5) on-demand, HTML-based training courses, which include:
  - Purchase Training for Card/Account Holders/AOs
  - Travel Training for Card/Account Holders/AOs
  - Purchase Training for A/OPCs
  - Travel Training for A/OPCs
  - Fleet Training for A/OPCs

Certificates are issued after the completion of a multiple question quiz with a passing score of 75%. There are approximately 700,000 current accounts and just under 600,000 visitors in FY22.

All information posted on the GSA SmartPay main website and GSA SmartPay training website is public. The Government owns all code, data, image licenses, user information, and domain names.

The intention is to decommission the existing Drupal program and training websites. The scope of this procurement does not include maintenance of these sites. 

#### 1.1.2 Minimally Viable Products
Currently, CCCM program has partnered with the [GSA Service Delivery team](https://github.com/GSA/service-delivery) to build a minimally viable product (MVP) of the main website and training website using an iterative and user-centered delivery cadence. The Service Delivery team expects the MVP for each website to be delivered by summer 2023 and will work with the Contractor to transition the project. 

The new GSA SmartPay main website ([GitHub](https://github.com/GSA/smartpay-website)) will:
- Be hosted on [Cloud.gov Pages](https://cloud.gov/pages/) (formerly known as Federalist).
- Leverage the static site generator, [Astro](https://astro.build/).
- Incorporate the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).

The above-mentioned 889 tool will be migrated from Google Cloud Platform to Cloud.gov and Cloud.gov Pages before launch of the new GSA SmartPay main website.

The new GSA SmartPay training website ([GitHub](https://github.com/GSA/smartpay-training)) will be a combination of static web content and a custom training application ([Astro with Vue.js](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vue/) components) with a database-backed API component using [FastAPI/python](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/) connecting with a PostgreSQL database. The training website will be hosted on Cloud.gov (backend) and Cloud.gov Pages (front end).

#### 1.1.3 Future state
CCCM is seeking a Contractor to take the MVP of each website and continue future development. The Contractor will continue to build off the open source code developed by the Service Delivery team and develop enhanced functionality based on user needs, programmatic needs, and changes in policy. The Contractor will need to continue to add content and functionality using GitHub. 

The Service Delivery team is available to support transition. 

Implementation and documentation is ongoing — current specifications are published to the Github repositories. These repositories include supplementary information to this RFQ (see also Wikis found [here](https://github.com/GSA/smartpay-website/wiki) and [here](https://github.com/GSA/smartpay-training/wiki)).

CCCM has a large user base and can facilitate recruitment of users for ongoing research and usability testing. CCCM has robust survey results, user research, and ongoing usability testing feedback they will share with the Contractor upon award.
